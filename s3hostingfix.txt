# ☁️ S3 Static Website Hosting Fix

**Task:** Set up and fix public access issues for static front-end hosting via AWS S3.

---

## ✅ What Was Done

Uploaded the enhanced HTML files to S3 and resolved the **403 Access Denied** issue by adjusting permissions and enabling static website hosting.

---

## 🔧 Steps Taken

1. Opened **AWS S3 Console** → Selected the bucket (e.g., `weather-frontend-app`)
2. Went to **Permissions** tab:
   - Clicked **Edit** under *Block public access*
   - **Unchecked "Block all public access"**
   - Confirmed and saved changes
3. Under **Bucket Policy**, added:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
*(Replace `<your-bucket-name>` with the actual bucket name)*

4. In the **Properties** tab:
   - Enabled **Static website hosting**
   - Set index document: `page1.html`
   - Set error document: `page2.html`

5. Uploaded the latest versions of `page1.html`, `page2.html`, and tested the public S3 URL.
